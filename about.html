			<h1>Campbell Soup Cans</h1>
			<p>Campbell Soup Cans produced by the Campbell Soup company was a highly consumed product in the 1950s. In 1962, Warhol famously recreated the familiar look of the soup cans onto 32 canvases. The artwork was originally displayed together on shelves, similar to how grocery stores display their products.
			Even though the artwork resembles the mass produced soup cans, each of Warholâ€™s canvases are hand painted and hand printed. Warhol mimicked the uniformity and the rhythm of the soup cans by carefully recreating each painting across each canvas.</p>
