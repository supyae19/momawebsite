			<h3>Andy Warhol</h3>
			<p>Andy Warhol is an American Artist who was a leading figure in the visual art movement known as pop art. Warhol has been the topic of many retrospective exhibitions, volumes, features and movies. The Andy Warhol Museum at his native city of Pittsburg carries the broad enduring publication of artwork and collections, is the largest museum in the United States devoted to a single artist. Some of his creations are collectibble and extremely important.
			Andy Warhol was a man of many talents. He was a fashion illustrator, painter, printmaker, sculptor, magazine publisher, filmmaker, photographer, and de facto archivist of his times. For his early paintings, he drew on his experiences as a commercial illustrator, appropriating motifs from advertising in his work.</p>

			<h3>Campbell Soup Cans</h3>
			<p>Campbell Soup Cans produced by the Campbell Soup company was a highly consumed product in the 1950s. In 1962, Warhol famously recreated the familiar look of the soup cans onto 32 canvases. The artwork was originally displayed together on shelves, similar to how grocery stores display their products.
			Even though the artwork resembles the mass produced soup cans, each of Warhol's canvases are hand painted and hand printed. Warhol mimicked the uniformity and the rhythm of the soup cans by carefully recreating each painting across each canvas.
			Shortly after Warhol completed the Campbell Soup Cans, he turned to the photo-silkscreen process. A printmaking technique originally invented for commercial use, it would become his signature medium and art style.</p>

			<h3>Pop Art Movement</h3>
			<p>Pop art is an art movement that emerged in the United Kingdom and the United States during the mid- to late-1950s. The movement presented a challenge to traditions of fine art by including imagery from popular and mass culture, such as advertising, comic books and mundane mass-produced objects. One of its aims is to use images of popular (as opposed to elitist) culture in art, emphasizing the banal or kitschy elements of any culture, most often through the use of irony. It is also associated with the artists' use of mechanical means of reproduction or rendering techniques. In pop art, material is sometimes visually removed from its known context, isolated, or combined with unrelated material.</p>
